# Lex-Guard

This pipeline provides an AI-powered compliance assistant that leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to help businesses efficiently navigate and comply with complex regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001. By ingesting regulatory documents, indexing them in a vector database, and using AI to generate context-aware answers, the system enables real-time, accurate responses to compliance-related queries. The goal is to reduce manual effort, improve compliance efficiency, and scale with the growing volume of regulatory documents.
